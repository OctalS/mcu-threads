mcu-threads: API
================

The very first thing you must do is to define a new "main" function.
We would call this 'main_thread'. The idea is that we are transforming
the environment from a single tasking to multitasking.
To do this you need to invoke:

        void threads_init(void (*fn)(void));

where 'fn' is your main_thread.

Now you are in threading context and can start creating new threads.
This is simply achieved by:

        void thread_create(thread_t *t, void *fn);

where:
  't': is a globally defined variable of type thread_t
  'fn': is your thread function to execute

Don't use return statement at the end of your threading function.
Instead to exit from a thread use:

        void thread_exit(void);

This will safely terminate the current thread and will give the CPU to the next running one.

The library also supports thread sleeping on a condition.
To use this functionality first you need to define global wait queue with:

        DEFINE_WAIT_QUEUE(name);

where:
  'name': is the name of your queue

To put the thread waiting on an event:

        thread_wait(wq, cond);

where:
  'wq': pointer to your wait queue
  'cond': the condition that should be waited on

You can put as many threads as you like in the same wait queue or define different for each one.
This is up to you.

Waking up threads can be achieved in two ways: normal or with an urgent priority.

Normal wake up:

        void thread_wakeup(thread_t **wq);

where:
  'wq': is the wait queue holding sleeping threads.

This will wakeup all threads in the wait queue, but only those that meet their sleeping condition
will be really awaken. The other ones will be put back to sleep.
No context switch will occur after this function. This means that the threads will be awaken in a
lazy fashion and will not be executed by the system immediately. If you are in a hurry and want
threads to be executed right away use;

        void thread_wakeup_now(thread_t **wq);
 
This will give the CPU to the first thread in the wait queue immediately.
Hence a context switch will occur.

If you want to put a thread asleep unconditionally for some reason use:

        void thread_sleep(thread_t **wq, thread_t *t);
